# Fedora Haskell Packaging Plans

An org-mode file to help plan Fedora Haskell packaging efforts.
See the [Fedora Haskell SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Haskell_SIG) for details about packaging.

Contributions are welcome if you have a Haskell stack you plan to get into Fedora.
Note Fedora Haskell follows package versions from Stackage LTS, so if the package set is not yet in Stackage it would be better to add them there first.

Dependent packages are listed at lower levels below their dependencies.
